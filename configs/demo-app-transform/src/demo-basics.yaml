# Configuration for an IAG container. In addition to basic configuration, this
# file specifies a junction to a demonstration application.
#
# HTTP Transformation and response content injection configuration is
# specified in a separate file.

server:

  #
  # Specify a server certificate to be used by the container.  The server
  # certificate was created using an openssl command:
  #  openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout key.pem -x509 -days 365 \
  #        -out cert.pem
  #
  # The key.pem and cert.pem files were then combined into a single file:
  #  cat cert.pem key.pem > iag.certkey.pem
  #
  # To remove the dependency on an external file a base-64 representation of the
  # certificate can be embedded within this yaml, where the base-64 encoded
  # certificate is prefixed with 'B64:', for example: "B64:PGhy4KICAgIDxoND5...."
  #
  # If no certificate is specified a self-signed certificate will be
  # automatically created and used by the container.

  # Enable the inbuilt credential viewer application.  The 'enable_html'
  # configuration entry will control whether the HTML file is enabled in
  # addition to the JSON API.
